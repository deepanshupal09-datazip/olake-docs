## Introduction to OLake
 

**OLake** is a blazing-fast open-source tool that replicates data from diverse sources into Apache Iceberg and Parquet, delivering real-time lakehouse analytics without the pain of ETL scripts or vendor lock-in.

**GitHub Repository:** [https://github.com/datazip-inc/olake](https://github.com/datazip-inc/olake)  


## What is OLake?  

OLake is an open-source ELT framework, fully written in Golang for memory efficiency and high performance. It replicates data from sources like PostgreSQL, MySQL, MongoDB, Oracle and Kafka (WIP) directly into open lakehouse formats such as Apache Iceberg and Parquet.
Using Incremental Sync and Change Data Capture (CDC), OLake keeps data continuously in sync while minimizing infrastructure overhead—offering a simple, reliable, and scalable path to building a modern lakehouse.

This allows organizations to:  
- Replicate data at scale  
- Power near real-time analytics  
- Transform data lakes into fully functional lakehouses without the overhead of complex ETL tools

## Why OLake?  

- **Fastest Path to a Lakehouse** → Achieve high throughput with **parallelized chunking** and **resumable** historical snapshots and blazing-fast incremental updates, even on massive datasets with **exactly-once** delivery.  

- **Efficient Data Capture** → Capture data efficiently with a full snapshot of your tables or collections, then keep them in sync through near real-time **CDC** using native database logs (**WAL, binlogs, oplogs**).  

- **Schema-Aware Replication** → Automatically detect schema changes to keep your pipelines consistent and reliable.  

- **Open by Design** → Store data in **open formats** like Parquet and Iceberg, enabling **engine-agnostic analytics** and eliminating vendor lock-in.
