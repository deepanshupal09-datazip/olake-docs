# Use Cases for OLake

### 1. Offloading OLTP Databases for Analytics
Running complex analytical queries directly on production **OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) databases** can degrade performance and affect transactional workloads.

OLake addresses this by replicating data from **MySQL**, **PostgreSQL**, **Oracle**, and **MongoDB** into an **Apache Iceberg** based data lake.

This approach provides:

- **Workload separation** → Keep analytics independent from production databases.

- **Faster performance** → Run queries on Iceberg tables optimized for analytics.

- **Efficient bootstrapping** → Use full-load sync for initial data migration.

- **Resilience** → Dead Letter Queue (DLQ) ensures schema changes don’t break pipelines.

With OLake, you can maintain stable transactional systems while enabling scalable and reliable analytics on **Apache Iceberg**.

### 2. Building Open Data Stacks and Scaling Data Engineering
Organizations looking to reduce reliance on proprietary ETL and data warehousing tools can use **OLake** as part of an **open-source data stack**. By standardizing on **Apache Iceberg** as the table format, OLake ensures broad compatibility with query engines like **Trino**, **Presto**, **Spark**, **Dremio**, and **DuckDB**.

With its open-source approach, OLake helps teams:

- **Replace managed ETL/replication services** with a community-driven alternative.

- **Customize and extend** the platform through its open codebase.

- **Standardize data lake storage** on Apache Iceberg.

- **Avoid vendor lock-in** tied to closed formats and tools.

Support multiple query engines across different use cases and teams.

This enables a **flexible**, **scalable**, and **future-proof data architecture** built on open standards.

### 3. Enabling Near-Real-Time Analytics
Modern applications need fresh data within minutes, not hours. **OLake** enables near-real-time analytics by continuously replicating data from transactional databases using **log-based CDC**, often achieving **sub-minute** latency for updates to appear in **Iceberg**.

Key benefits:

- **Low-latency** ingestion with log-based CDC.

- **Incremental processing** powered by Apache Iceberg.

- **Efficient queries** using Iceberg optimizations like **hidden partitioning**, **metadata pruning**, 

This allows teams to run **fast**, **cost-efficient analytics** on frequently updated data.

### 4. Cost-Effective Data Retention and Compliance
Storing historical data for compliance, audits, or analysis can be costly in traditional data warehouses. **OLake** addresses this by replicating data into **Apache Iceberg**, which stores it on cost-efficient object storage (e.g., S3, GCS).

With Iceberg, data remains **immediately queryable** across compatible engines—no rehydration needed. Its built-in schema evolution ensures that structural changes over time don’t break access to historical data.

Key benefits:

- Store large historical datasets at **lower cost**.

- Keep retained data **instantly queryable**.

- Meet **compliance and auditing needs** with long-term retention.

Adapt to schema changes seamlessly with Iceberg.

### 5. Powering AI and ML Data Pipelines
Building effective AI and ML models requires **fresh**, **reliable**, and **structured data**. **OLake** automates the ingestion of transactional data into an **Iceberg-based lakehouse**, ensuring that pipelines always have access to the latest information.

With continuous updates, ML feature stores and training datasets stay current, while Iceberg’s compatibility with engines like **PySpark** and **DuckDB** makes it easy to plug into existing data science workflows. This supports faster model development and iteration.

Key benefits:

- **Automate ingestion of transactional data** for ML feature stores.

- Provide **consistent, up-to-date data** for training and evaluation.

- **Seamlessly integrate** with ML processing engines (e.g., PySpark, DuckDB).

### 6. Simplifying Change Data Capture
Setting up scalable CDC pipelines is often complex. **OLake** makes this easier by providing an open-source solution purpose-built for **database-to-Iceberg replication**.

It uses **log-based CDC** for minimal impact on source databases, supports schema evolution to handle structural changes, and includes a **Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)** for reliable error handling. The design aligns with open-source streaming concepts, ensuring flexibility and robustness.

Key benefits:

- Log-based CDC with low impact on source systems.

- Automatic handling of schema changes.

- Dead Letter Queue for dependable error management.

### 7. Reducing Cloud Data Warehouse Costs
Cloud data warehouses can become expensive due to storage and compute costs. **OLake** helps reduce these expenses by offloading raw, historical, or less frequently used data into an **Iceberg lakehouse** on cost-effective object storage.

This lets teams keep their warehouse optimized for active data, while still retaining full access to complete datasets in Iceberg.

Key benefits:

- Lower costs by storing large datasets in Iceberg on object storage.

- Optimize warehouse usage for critical, high-value data.
