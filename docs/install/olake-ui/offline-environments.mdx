# OLake UI for Offline Environments (AWS)

OLake UI can be deployed in offline or air‑gapped AWS environments by using an Amazon ECR pull‑through cache to mirror required Docker images. This guide outlines how to configure the pull-through cache, pre‑pull connector images, and run OLake UI.

ECR pull-through cache is an AWS service that automatically mirrors and caches Docker images from external registries like Docker Hub into your private ECR registry for offline access.


## Prerequisites

The following are required to begin:

- An active **AWS account** with `Administrator Access` IAM permissions
- A **Docker Hub account** with permission to generate `Personal Access Token`
- **Docker installed** and configured on the machine where OLake UI is set up
- The **AWS CLI installed** and configured on the machine where OLake UI is set up

## 1. Docker Hub Access Token

To authenticate ECR Pull Through Cache with Docker Hub, a Personal Access Token (PAT) must be created. This token will be used by AWS to pull images.

1. Log in to the Docker Hub account
2. Navigate to **Account Settings > Personal access tokens**
3. Provide a description for the token (e.g., "Access Token for ECR pull-through cache")
4. Set expiration date to **None**
5. Set the access permissions. For this use case, **Public Repo Read-only** access is sufficient
6. Click **Generate**

</div>

:::warning Important
Copy the generated token and store it in a secure location. The token will not be visible again after the window is closed.
:::

For more detailed instructions, refer to the [official Docker documentation on creating access tokens](https://docs.docker.com/docker-hub/access-tokens/).

## 2. Store Docker Hub Credentials in AWS Secrets Manager

Next, the Docker Hub credentials must be securely stored in AWS Secrets Manager. This allows ECR to authenticate with Docker Hub without exposing credentials in code or configuration files.

1. Open the AWS Management Console and navigate to **Secrets Manager**
2. Click **Store a new secret**
3. For the **Secret type**, select **Other type of secret**
4. In the **Key/value pairs** section, create two key-value pairs:
   - **Key**: `username`, **Value**: Your Docker Hub username
   - **Key**: `accessToken`, **Value**: The Docker Hub Personal Access Token created in the previous step
5. For the **Secret name**, enter a descriptive name with the prefix `ecr-pullthroughcache/`. For example: `ecr-pullthroughcache/dockerhub-credentials`
6. Skip to the **Review** step and leave other values as default
7. Click **Store** to save the secret

## 3. Create the ECR Pull-Through Cache Rule

Now, the pull-through cache rule can be created in ECR. This rule instructs ECR to cache images from Docker Hub whenever they are pulled through the private registry.

1. In the AWS Management Console, navigate to **Elastic Container Registry (ECR)**
2. In the left-hand menu, under **Private registry** click on **Features and Settings** to expand, select **Pull through cache**
3. Click **Add rule**
4. For the **Upstream registry**, select **Docker Hub** (note that `registry-1.docker.io` is the official Docker Hub registry by default)
5. For **Authentication**, select **Use an existing AWS secret** and choose the secret created in Step 2
6. For the **Cache repository prefix**, enter a prefix that will be used to create new repositories for the cached images (e.g., `dockerhub`)
7. For the **Upstream namespace**, choose **No Prefix**
8. Click **Create**

## 4. Configure IAM Permissions

With the ECR Pull-through cache rule created, the necessary IAM permissions can be configured. An IAM role with the correct policy must be attached to the machine where OLake UI will be run.

The policy should include the following permissions. Ensure the resource ARN is updated with the correct `region`, `account ID`, and the `ECR repository prefix` created in the previous section:

```json
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "ECRLogin",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "ecr:GetAuthorizationToken",
            "Resource": "*"
        },
        {
            "Sid": "PullFromDockerHubWithPrefix",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "ecr:CreatePullThroughCacheRule",
                "ecr:CreateRepository",
                "ecr:GetDownloadUrlForLayer",
                "ecr:GetAuthorizationToken",
                "ecr:BatchImportUpstreamImage",
                "ecr:BatchGetImage",
                "ecr:GetImageCopyStatus",
                "ecr:InitiateLayerUpload",
                "ecr:UploadLayerPart",
                "ecr:CompleteLayerUpload",
                "ecr:PutImage",
                "ecr:ListImages",
                "ecr:DescribeImages"
            ],
            "Resource": [
                "arn:aws:ecr:<region>:<aws_account_id>:repository/<ecr_repository_prefix>",
                "arn:aws:ecr:<region>:<aws_account_id>:repository/<ecr_repository_prefix>/*"
            ]
        }
    ]
}
```

## 5. Configure VPC Endpoints for Offline Environments

For a truly isolated environment, VPC endpoints need to be configured. This allows instances to communicate with AWS services without traversing the public internet.

The following VPC endpoints need to be created:

- `com.amazonaws.<region>.ecr.api`
- `com.amazonaws.<region>.ecr.dkr`
- `com.amazonaws.<region>.s3` (ECR uses S3 to store image layers)

For detailed instructions on creating VPC endpoints, please refer to the [AWS documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/vpc/latest/privatelink/vpc-endpoints.html).

## 6. Pre-pull Connector Images

The OLake UI spins up separate Docker containers for different data sources (connectors). These connector images must also be pulled through the ECR pull-through cache before starting the main application stack.

Run the following commands on the machine where Docker Compose will be run. These commands will pull the necessary connector images and ensure they are cached in the private ECR. Replace `<version>` with the specific connector version required. Only **use stable release versions** (e.g., `v0.1.8`).

```bash
# Docker login for AWS ECR repository
aws ecr get-login-password --region <region> | docker login --username AWS --password-stdin <account_id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com

# MySQL Connector
docker pull <aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/<ecr_repository_prefix>/olakego/source-mysql:<version>

# PostgreSQL Connector
docker pull <aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/<ecr_repository_prefix>/olakego/source-postgres:<version>

# MongoDB Connector
docker pull <aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/<ecr_repository_prefix>/olakego/source-mongodb:<version>

# Oracle DB Connector
docker pull <aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/<ecr_repository_prefix>/olakego/source-oracle:<version>
```

:::info Note
This pre-pull step is a one-time action for each connector version. Once an image is pulled, it is cached within the private ECR.
:::

## 7. Run the Application Stack

With the pull-through cache configured and connector images pre-pulled, the main OLake application can be started. The OLake docker-compose.yml is designed to use an environment variable to specify the container registry. This makes it easy to switch from Docker Hub to a private ECR.

### Configure the Environment

In the same directory where the OLake [docker-compose.yml](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/datazip-inc/olake-ui/refs/heads/master/docker-compose.yml) file is located, a new file named `.env` must be created.

The `.env` file should contain the following line:

```bash
CONTAINER_REGISTRY_BASE="<aws_account_id>.dkr.ecr.<region>.amazonaws.com/<ecr_repository_prefix>"

# Example: CONTAINER_REGISTRY_BASE="111222333444.dkr.ecr.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dockerhub"
```

Replace `<aws_account_id>` and `<region>` with the appropriate AWS account ID and region. The `<ecr_repository_prefix>` must be replaced with the value created earlier.

The docker-compose.yml file for OLake is already configured to use this `CONTAINER_REGISTRY_BASE` variable for all service images. No modifications to the docker-compose.yml file itself are necessary.

### Start OLake UI

With the environment configured, start the OLake UI stack:

```bash
# Start the application stack
docker-compose up -d
```

## Access the OLake UI

The OLake UI will be available at:
- **URL**: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)
- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: `password`

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**ECR Authentication Failures:**
- Ensure the IAM role has the correct ECR permissions

**Image Pull Failures:**
- Confirm the pull-through cache rule is correctly configured
- Verify the Docker Hub credentials in Secrets Manager
- Ensure VPC endpoints are properly set up for offline environments

**Service Startup Issues:**
- Check that all required images have been pre-pulled
- Verify the `.env` file contains the correct registry configuration
- Review Docker Compose logs: `docker-compose logs`
