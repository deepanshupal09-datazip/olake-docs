    summary: 'This session explores the evolution of metadata catalogs in the lakehouse era, the challenges organizations face with traditional solutions, and why open catalog standards are critical for interoperability. The focus will be on Apache Polaris, an Iceberg-native, open catalog designed to eliminate vendor lock-in and standardize metadata access. Attendees will gain both foundational understanding and technical insights into Polaris\'s architecture, setup flow, and adoption journey.',
